## Open Trivia Challenge 
 A responsive, customizable quiz app built using React & the Open Trivia API


## Overview 
Similar to Tindog, Open Trivia Challenge began as a project for consolidating React concepts taught in **Module 11 - React Basics** [Scrimba Frontend Career Path Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). 
The original version which had no user input, scoring system, score tracking, and rules section. I decided to add those additional features to create a more complete user experience.   

## Features
1) an input form to select # of questions, categories, difficulty, and question type
2) a triple timer system comprised of a bonus timer, a penalty timer, and an overtime penalty timer
3) a comprehensive points system which grants or deducts points based on the time left in the above timer
4) a scoreboard that stores each attempt in local storage
5) fully responsive design that scales according to screen sizes from iPhone SE (375px) to desktops (1000px or greater)
