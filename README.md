## Background
Similar to Tindog, Open Trivia Challenge began as a project for cosolidating React concepts taught in **Module 11 - React Basics** [Scrimba Frontend Career Path Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). 
The original version which had no user input, scoring system, score tracking, and rules section. I decided to add those additional features to create a more complete user experience.
